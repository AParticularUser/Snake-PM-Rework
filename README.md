# Snake-PM-Rework
A move-set overhaul for snake in SSBU, inspired by the PM/P+ mod for SSBB.

<sub>I'm a casual first, so this mod wasn't made with balance in mind.</sub>

## Change Log
- side-smash changed to 3 hit knife combo
- down-smash changed to spinning double kick
- f-air end-lag reduced
- landing back-air will leave snake in the prone position (like dash-attack)
- c4 can no longer fall off a stuck target (neither time nor knockback)
- c4 can stick to opponents while falling
- holding shield/grab during down-special will have snake stick himself
- side-special changed to tranq-gun
- holding left or right durring grab will make snake walk
  - pressing attack while walking will make snake do his normal side throws
- up-taunt changed to "infinate ammo" quote
- side-taunt changed to codec-call
- holding left or right durring down-taunt will make snake move while in his box
- holding neutral-special durring down-taunt will make snake spawn a grenade while in his box
- pressing down-special durring down-taunt will make snake place a c4 while in his box
  - pressing down-special again will make snake exit the box and detonate the c4
